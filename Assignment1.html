<br>
<p>ZhangJiaJie is located in central China, northwest Hunan Province, over 1000 kilometers from both Shanghai and Beijing.
<br>
ZhangJiaJie is famous for its precarious peaks, limpid streams, dense forests, and large karst caves. Notably, the movie
<br>
"Avatar" was filmed mostly in ZhangJiaJie, which gained popularity after the blockbuster premiered in 2009.

<br>
<p>Visitors cross the ZhangJiaJie Glass Bridge suspended 260 meters above a valley in ZhangJiaJie in China's Hunan
<br>
Province on August 21, 2016. It was the world's highest and longest glass-bottomed bridge when it opened.</p>

<h3>Wulingyuan Scenic Area</h3>
<p>Quartz sandstone pillars rise above the forested valley floor. The Bailong Elevator, a glass-enclosed observation
<br>
elevator that travels 326 meters up a cliffside in Wulingyuan Scenic Area, is one of the top sites to oversee
<br>
some of the most amazing views.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>ZhangJiaJie is a must go for those who are nature lovers and also those who just love a good view. The highlight
<br>
for me was the glass-bottomed bridge that suspends incredibly high, which was pretty nerve-racking for me. If
<br>
you have a couple of extra days, you can opt to take a boat ride on Baofeng Lake and explore China's largest karst
<br>
cave, the Yellow Dragon Cave. Nearby Fenghuang Ancient Town can be a great option if you are interested in
<br>
Chinese ancient towns. This could be a good getaway from the hectic and fast-paced Singaporean life!</p>
